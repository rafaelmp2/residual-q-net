# Residual Q-Network

Main codes adapted from [SMAC framework](https://github.com/starry-sky6688/StarCraft) to be used with the environments from the [MA-gym](https://github.com/koulanurag/ma-gym) collection. Also, please see the source repository to see the original framework used with starcraft environments. Acknowledgements also to [pymarl](https://github.com/oxwhirl/pymarl) and [SMAC](https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac) for starcraft environemnts.
